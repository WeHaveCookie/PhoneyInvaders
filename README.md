## Presentation
A Phoney Mothership just imprisoned the Earth in an insane eternal silence, cutting out sound for all living being. A life without music and sound is so boringâ€¦ It is up to you to keep that beat up whilst repealing the Phoney alien attack ships. It is your only hope! Phoney Invaders is about defending your core from waves of funky neon invaders that can only be destroyed by certain precise sound wave frequencies. The beat depends on your performance to defend the Earth. As the Earth dies, so will the beat. Will you able to keep it up for the Earth?
